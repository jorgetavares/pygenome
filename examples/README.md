# PyGenome Examples

In this directory we can find examples of using the framework/library. The examples are to be illustrative of how to use the high-level functions that can be used to run a common GA/GP/ES/etc. algorithm or, how to code an algorithm using the library building blocks. The examples try to be simple and small. Some include different configurations to showcase the different possibilities. Later on we might include here more real-world type examples. The filename usually follows the following pattern: algoritm name (e.g., ga, es), problem name (e.g., onemax).
