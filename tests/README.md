# PyGenome Tests

This base directory contains the units tests for PyGenome using the framework [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/). The structure tries to follow the library structure as close as possible. Essentially this means that we can find the same directory structure found under pygenome and examples. For each module we should have a test_modulename.py file with the tests for that module. Some exceptions can occur, for example, all the tree-based tests are usually in a separate file.
