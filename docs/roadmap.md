Last update 2017/04/02.

* version 0.01

  + Main evolutionary paradigms: <s>GA, ES</s>, GP (+ STGP), GE and NEAT.
  + Representation: single chromossome only
  + Representation: <s>binary, integer, permutation, floats, parse trees</s>
  + Replacement: <s>generational, steady-state, basic elitism, mu,lambda, mu+lambda</s>
  + Selection: <s>roulette-wheel and tournament</s>
  + Selection: minimization only (maximization problems must convert)
  + Crossover and mutation: only minimum required set to have main EAs working
  + Fitness: single objective
  + Examples for all EAs (framework and library)
  + Basic logging and population statistics
  + Unit tests

* version 0.02

  + Fitness: multi-objective (NSGA-2, SPEAR)
  + ES: add CMA-ES
  + GP: add strongly-typed 
  + Paradigm: DE
