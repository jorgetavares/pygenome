# PyGenome
Evolutionary Algorithms in Python

+ Main evolutionary paradigms: GA, ES, GP (+ STGP) and GE
+ Genotype: single and dual chromossomes
+ Genotype: binary, integer, permutation, floats, parse trees
+ Replacement: generational, steady-state, basic elitism, (mu,lambda), (mu+lambda)
+ Selection: roulette-wheel and tournament (including negative)
+ Selection: minimization only (maximization problems must convert)
+ Crossover and mutation: only minimum required set to have main EAs working
+ Fitness: single objective
+ Examples for implemented EAs
+ Basic logging and population statistics
